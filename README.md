### Professional Experience
**Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ**  
**FURI Research Aide** | 05/2024 - Present  
Leading the Vision AI Insights Project: Applying Machine Learning and OCR Libraries to Solve Real-World Challenges with a Team of Three Members.

- Conducted an in-depth analysis of YOLOv10, highlighting its innovative NMS-Free Training, which eliminates the Non-Maximum Suppression step, thereby reducing inference time and improving real-time performance.
- Evaluated the effectiveness of Spatial-Channel Decoupled DownSampling and Rank-Guided Block Design in YOLOv10, demonstrating significant improvements in computational efficiency and model performance for real-time object detection tasks.
- Implemented a cost-effective OCR solution by integrating PyTesseract for image quality assessment and Amazon Textract for high-quality image processing, optimizing resource utilization and minimizing unnecessary transaction costs.
- Designed and developed a web application using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and JavaFx to display OCR-extracted information on the frontend, integrating backend processing and deploying the server with Docker for streamlined deployment and scalability.

**NGL Transportation INC, Phoenix, AZ**  
**Software Engineering Intern** | 01/2022 - 01/2023  
Led an OCR Project to detect container numbers, significantly reducing truck transit times at the gate.

- Enhanced image detection accuracy by 20% by developing and refining a YOLOv5 AI model for improved feature recognition in container images.
- Reduced image processing time by 30% using OpenCV for efficient image parsing and pre-processing workflows.
- Streamlined real-time data integration by automating JSON data transmission via POST API to an AWS server, decreasing data entry errors by 15%.
- Managed over 10,000 daily data transactions on AWS S3, MySQL, optimizing database schemas and storage practices for enhanced data security and accessibility.

Led the KPI Automatic Project, developing an executable program to automate data crawling tasks, significantly boosting operational efficiency.

- Utilized Selenium to extract necessary information from web pages, achieving the desired result.
- Automated data crawling tasks that typically took 20 minutes to complete manually, allowing for instant results with a click of a button and reducing task completion time by 80%.
- Converted the application into an executable (EXE) file and distributed it to all employees, resulting in increased work efficiency and streamlined operations.

### Military
**Hanbit Unit 12th of United Nations (UN), Bor, South Sudan**
